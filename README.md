# Experimental Study

An experimental study utilizing a 2^k Factorial design, where k=2 with 3 replications. The study aimed to discover whether training style ( High Intensity Interval Training/ Steady State) and Resistance Level (Low resistance/High resistance) has an impact on the number of calories burned while cycling for 10 minutes on a stationary bike.

It was found that HIIT resulted in a higher amount of calories burned, Low resistance resulted in more calories burned, and the ideal biking style which would yield the highest number of calories burned would be HIIT at Low Resistance.
